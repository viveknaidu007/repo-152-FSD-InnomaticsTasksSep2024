    "You're correct that in the media queries provided, there's no explicit mention of \"tablet\" or \"mobile\" in terms of specific device types. Instead, the CSS relies on **screen width** to determine when to apply changes, not the specific device type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Max-Width**:\n",
    "   - The `@media (max-width: 768px)` and `@media (max-width: 480px)` breakpoints refer to screen widths, not device types.\n",
    "   - A screen width of **768px or below** is commonly associated with tablets, while **480px or below** is often associated with mobile devices. These widths were chosen based on common device resolutions, but they are general guidelines rather than strict rules for tablets or mobiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Differentiate Between Tablet and Mobile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tablet (max-width: 768px)**:\n",
    "  - The layout adapts when the screen width is 768px or smaller. While this is often the width of many tablets, it also covers smaller laptops or larger phones in landscape mode.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mobile (max-width: 480px)**:\n",
    "  - The layout changes again when the screen width is 480px or smaller, which typically applies to most mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, even though we don't explicitly define the terms \"tablet\" or \"mobile,\" the CSS breakpoints are chosen based on typical screen widths for these devices. If you'd like to clarify the comments, you can adjust them like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/* For screens 768px and below (typically tablets) */\n",
    "@media (max-width: 768px) {\n",
    "    body {\n",
    "        grid-template-areas: \n",
    "            \"header header\"\n",
    "            \"nav nav\"\n",
    "            \"main aside\"\n",
    "            \"footer footer\";\n",
    "        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "/* For screens 480px and below (typically mobile phones) */\n",
    "@media (max-width: 480px) {\n",
    "    body {\n",
    "        grid-template-areas: \n",
    "            \"header\"\n",
    "            \"nav\"\n",
    "            \"main\"\n",
    "            \"aside\"\n",
    "            \"footer\";\n",
    "        grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Responsiveness:\n",
    "To test how the design adapts across different screen sizes:\n",
    "- **Developer Tools (F12):** Use browser developer tools (like Chrome DevTools) to simulate different device resolutions by selecting devices (e.g., iPhone, iPad).\n",
    "- **Resizing the browser:** Resize your browser window to visually see how the layout adjusts at different screen widths (768px and 480px).\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you're ensuring that the layout works across various screen sizes without hardcoding specific devices."
